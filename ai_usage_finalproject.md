# AI Use Log For Final Project

# TASK 1 - Proposal 
- Tool/model & version: ChatGPT-5
- What I asked for: To review idea for machine learning workflow.
- Snippet of prompt(s): "Is this a reasonable approach to train a machine learning model using supervised learning to detect trends (decreasing, increasing or stable) in bird abundance data and identify the environmental variables that are most predictive of these trends: First do a correlation analysis to determine which environmental variables are correlated with the trends in the training bird population data. Then use supervised learning thorugh a decision tree and random forest approach to train on one dataset, rank which environmental variables are the most prediction of the population trends and then test on a different dataset. Also to determine how well the model the is working, how should I determine this?"
- How I verified correctness (tests, sample data): Verfied the output by comparing to class notes and primary literature.

# TASK 2 - Data Preprocessing
- Tool/model & version: ChatGPT-5
- What I asked for: To convert python colab code (the baseline classifiers with pipelines, confusion matrix, cross-validation & small grid search) to R code.
- Snippet of prompt(s): "convert python colab code to R code"
- How I verified correctness (tests, sample data): Verified it worked by running though R, and installing additional packages that were necesarry to run the code.
